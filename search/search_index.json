For any additional accounts they can be added by going to the accounts menu, and then tapping the 'Add account' option in the overflow menu. First you are asked for your email address and password. The buttons \"Manual setup\" and \"Next\" become only activated after a correctly formatted email address and a password have been typed in. If you choose \"Next\" and the domain part of your email address is known to K-9 Mail, the connection settings for the incoming and outgoing server are automatically set up for you. This is the case for some large email providers, e.g. Gmail, Yahoo!, and AOL. We also list information on the settings for major e-mail providers . Account Type If you need to configure it manually, you will need to first choose an account type. The available options are POP3, IMAP, and WebDAV (supported by Exchange versions up to 2007). All of these are names of protocols to access your mailbox. If your email provider supports it, we strongly recommend you use IMAP. It is superior to the others and well supported by K-9 Mail. For more information see the linked Wikipedia entries: IMAP POP3 WebDAV Incoming Server Settings To configure your incoming server settings see the corresponding page IMAP POP3 WebDAV Configuring the outgoing server To be able to send mail K-9 Mail needs to know the settings to your provider's SMTP server. In this step of the account creation process you have to provide those details. Below is an explanation of the different settings. In certain circumstances, you may need to use a different outgoing server than you'd expect; we'll discuss those later. Because of the nature of email service, you often (if not always, these days) send outgoing mail to one server, but pick up incoming mail from a separate one; this is why many of the items below say \"this is often, but not always, the same as the setting for incoming mail\". SMTP server : This is the hostname or IP address of your SMTP server. As discussed above under IMAP Server , this name or IP must be accessible from any network from which you may want to send mail, whether your cellular carrier's WAN or a private LAN via Wi-Fi. See below for more details if you have trouble. Security type : This specifies the cryptographic protocol that should be used when connecting to your SMTP server. Available options are: None: This doesn't use any transport security at all. SSL/TLS (if available): SSL/TLS is used but the certificate isn't checked. SSL/TLS (always) : SSL/TLS is used and it's checked if the certificate is valid. STARTTLS (if available): The STARTTLS method is used if available; the certificate isn't checked. If STARTTLS is not available, no encryption is used at all. STARTTLS (always) : The STARTTLS method is used and the certificate is checked for validity. Port : The port number your provider's SMTP is listening on. This may be 465 or 587 , and in rare cases 25 , depending on the configuration and transport security settings of your server and K-9. Require sign-in : Tells K-9 Mail whether or not it will be expected to authenticate to the server. In almost all cases this needs to remain checked. Authentication type : This specifies which authentication method to use. Available options are: AUTOMATIC : This is the default method that will automatically detect which authentication methods are supported. You shouldn't need to change this. LOGIN : This uses the LOGIN authentication method. PLAIN : This uses the PLAIN authentication method. CRAM_MD5 : Use this if your server doesn't support transport security but supports the CRAM_MD5 authentication method. Username : The username that's needed to authenticate to the SMTP server. This is usually equal to either the left-hand side of, or the entire, email address; your mail server operator should have told you what to use as an Outgoing username -- and it will commonly be identical to the incoming username, though not always. Password : The password that's needed to authenticate to the SMTP server. This is often, though not always, identical to the password for the incoming server. To complete the outgoing server configuration click \"Next\". And again, K-9 Mail tries to connect to the server to verify the settings you just entered. Account options After successfully setting up the incoming and outgoing servers, you can now configure some basic settings on how often K-9 Mail checks for new messages, if you want to be notified of new mail, etc. These settings are specific to each account/mailbox you configure; you can set them differently for different mailboxes. Folder poll frequency : Here you specify in what interval K-9 Mail should check the incoming server to see if there are new messages. Available options are: Never Every minute Every 5 minutes Every 10 minutes Every 15 minutes Every 30 minutes Every hour Every 2 hours Every 3 hours Every 6 hours Every 12 hours Every 24 hours Enable push mail for this account : This option is only available for IMAP accounts. When it is enabled a long-lived connection to the IMAP server is established so K-9 Mail can be notified by the server when a new message has arrived. When this is set, you do not need to select a poll frequency, because you do not poll. This decreases delivery notification delay and thus for some it is worth choosing a mailbox based on the provider support for IMAP IDLE. Note that it may require multiple connections which might not be supported or undesired by the server administration. Number of messages to display : This value determines how many messages are kept locally cached and displayed. Available options are: 25 messages 50 messages 100 messages 250 messages 500 messages 1000 messages all messages Higher values have some performance implications. See Local folder size for more information. Notify me when mail arrives : If this is checked you are notified when a new message was downloaded in this mailbox. Notification type (LED, vibration) and ringtone can be configured later. See Notifications for more information. Notify me while mail is being checked : If this option is enabled K-9 Mail will inform the user when an account is being synchronized by displaying a message in the Android title bar. Last step To complete the account creation you have to fill out the following two fields: Give this account a name (optional): This is the name of the account that will be displayed in the account list. If you leave this field empty the email address associated with this account will be used. Type your name : This will be used as your name for messages sent using this account.

Some servers are okay with this; some, generally those which support multiple domains, require that you fill in your entire email address here. In this case, if you entered the entire email address on the previous screen, you will need to re-enter the hostname part here, as K-9 Mail doesn't know whether you need it and assumes you don't. Password : Here you enter the password to access your emails. The password you entered at the first step of the account creation process is pre-entered here. So you shouldn't need to change it. This password is the one which an administrator set for you or gave to you, which you use to retrieve mail from the mailbox. IMAP server : This is the hostname or IP address of your IMAP server. Note that this address must resolve to your mail server no matter what network you're connected to -- if you provide a name or IP that's only resolvable inside your private network , that's the only place you'll be able to pick up email.

What's with that icon? In some incarnations, Doctor Who had a robotic dog named \"K-9\" The dog was, in effect, an android mutt. When Jesse first created K-9, his goal was to create an Android mail client as good as the UNIX mail client mutt. The name was a natural fit. K-9's icon is a picture of...well, of K-9. How do I prevent K-9 Mail from reporting unread messages I already read from my desktop? I'm using POP3. This is a POP3 limitation: that protocol doesn't report/support READ/UNREAD status. IMAP addresses this limitation. How do I get back to the accounts overview screen? If you see a list of mails inside of a folder and you want to get back to the overview screen, you have to Press the menu button Select \"More\" Select \"Accounts\" Why can't I move K-9 Mail to the SD card? Google doesn't let programs installed on SD run as services, which we need to do in order to be able to fetch your mail. How do I change my Signature? Do the following to replace default signature in K-9 with your personal signature for any email account or stop K-9 default signature for that particular account: Open K-9, select email account in which you wish to create a signature. Key Sequence: Menu/Settings/Account Settings/Sending Mail/Composition Defaults In this dialog, you can enter Your Name, Your Email Address, Bcc all messages to, CHECK (or uncheck) USE SIGNATURE, enter your signature using correct syntax of top line of signature with -- followed by a line break, and enter your desired signature. Choose radio button to place Signature position before or after quoted text. How can I configure the Archive , Drafts , Sent , Spam and Trash folders? \"Account settings\" (via long click or Menu) > \"Folders\" (\"Incoming server\" in pre-3.400 versions) How can I attach *.xyz files? K-9 Mail uses the standard Android way to inherit external app features ( Intents ); you need a file manager application in order to choose any file. Compatible file managers: OI File Manager ( open source ) Why aren't my settings saved? Please use the Back key to leave all settings screens in order to trigger settings save. Why does \"Mark all messages as read\" say that there are messages I can't see? K-9 lets you choose to only sync the most recent messages to your phone. This particuar feature operates on all messages, even if you've chosen to sync only the last 10 messages to your phone. I'm having some trouble with a lot of concurrent connections to my IMAP server You've turned on \"push\" mail and marked a lot of folders for push. IMAP push requires one connection per folder. Why K-9 is using so much bandwidth to sync my POP mail? K-9 normally doesn't take much bandwidth. It is comparable to other Android mail applications such as GMail. However, there may be some situations where K-9 can consume up to 150k of bandwidth every time an account is refreshed. This normally happen when you have a POP account that has a huge inbox folder. If you have a inbox of about 2500 messages in it, it would generate data exchange between K-9 and the POP server in the order of 120k per refresh query. K-9 is crashing, please help! If you can't find a similar problem on our issue tracker , please file a new issue and provide a debug log and detailed steps on how to reproduce the problem if possible. Where is the source code? For the application see: the K-9 source code and developer wiki . For the website see: the K-9 website source code Why are there no release notes/list of changes for version X? We only publish release notes for stable releases (see next question) that are also pushed to Google Play (formerly Android Market). What is the difference between version 4.0xx and 4.1xx? In short: 4.0xx = stable / Google Play (Market) 4.1xx = unstable / development 4.2xx = the next stable 4.3xx = the next development See the pattern? If the digit after the dot is even, it's a stable release. If it is odd, it's a development release. Stable releases are changed only minimally when necessary, and should work just as well or better for all users when changed (i.e. going from 4.004 to 4.005). These are released to Google Play (formerly Android Market). It's a good idea to always update these, as they contain serious bug fixes and security updates, but you probably won't see anything different. Development releases are the latest and (hopefully) greatest, but may introduce new bugs or break things that were working before. You might find that K-9 no longer works on your device with an older version of Android (somewhere in 4.1xx we quit supporting Android older than 2.1, which means that K-9 4.2xx will only support Android 2.1 and newer). This is where new features happen (as well as bug fixes and security updates), and by using development releases you can help us to spot and fix new bugs early. Every version of K-9 is available to be downloaded here . They are sorted by date, most recent first, and you can see that some 4.0xx releases are listed above some 4.1xx releases. Often a 4.0xx release will happen at the same time as a 4.1xx release. What is the difference between pushing and polling? Depending on what type of account you have configured, K-9 may support either push or poll for fetching new mail (see Account settings > Fetching mail). At this time, K-9 only supports push for IMAP accounts. Polling refers to the mail client periodically asking the mail server for new mail, on some configured time increment. Pushing refers to the mail client keeping an open connection to the mail server, so that the server can inform the client of new mail as soon as it is received. Pushing typically uses more battery than periodic polling. First, when you have any account configured to push, this keeps an Android service running at all times. This service keeps 1 open connection to the mail server for each folder configured to push (which also uses battery power). And lastly, pushing will typically lead to more frequent communications between the client and the server. With polling however there is a delay between an email arriving and it being received (e.g. if it arrives just after the last poll it will be delayed for nearly an entire poll interval). At higher poll rates, the overhead of polling and not receiving any messages, plus the near constant connection being open makes it less battery efficient. Why is K-9 telling me, \"Syncing disabled\"? It will say this if there is no network, or if there are no folders set up to pull or push (inbox by default will), or if pull and push are both disabled, or if syncing is disabled for all K-9 accounts. Most of these settings are under Settings > Account settings > Fetching mail. See Folder poll frequency, Poll folders, and Push folders. To change a folder's class, long-press on the folder and select Folder settings. The global K-9 setting is under Settings > Global settings > Network > Background sync. If you are using Android version 6 or later, you are also likely to suffer from problems related to the \"Doze\" battery saving feature. For more information and potential workarounds see ticket 857 in the K-9 GitHub repository. I added a new folder to the account on the server - why don't I see it in K-9? K-9 currently does not automatically update the list of folders. To refresh, while viewing the current folders, select Menu > Folders > Refresh Folders. This will also delete folders from K-9 that have been removed from the server. How do I add additional Mail Accounts? When you start K-9 it goes to the inbox (or Unified Inbox if that is setup) At the top to left of the word Inbox there is the Dog Icon and to Left of that is a small < (less than symbol once) Tap once brings you to folders Tap it a second time brings you to Accounts Now from that screen you can tap the menu button (left of home button on G3). That will pop a menu where the first item is \"Add Account\" Note: If you are using Unified inbox, you only need to tap the < (less than symbol) How do I add Unified Mail Inbox? Start K-9 Tap Menu > Settings > Global Settings >Interaction check the \"start in Unified Inbox option Tap return to set When will 'X' be developed/released? K-9 has no fixed release schedule. Nor does it have any full-time developers at time of writing. Fixes to bugs and enhancements are done by interested developers according to their own priorities. In terms of releases: Big features tend to be released in isolation Stable releases are delayed until highly visible / common bugs are fixed Backporting bug fixes from the current unstable release to the current stable is generally reserved for bugs causing security vulnerabilities or data loss","title":"Frequently asked questions"},{"location":"misc/faq.html#frequently-asked-questions-faq","text":"","title":"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)"},{"location":"misc/faq.html#where-did-the-name-k-9-come-from-whats-with-that-icon","text":"In some incarnations, Doctor Who had a robotic dog named \"K-9\" The dog was, in effect, an android mutt.

To learn more about this, read the page Folders . Push folders Control whether to push all, 1st class, 2nd class or no folders. To learn more about this, read the page Folders . Note: This setting is only available for IMAP accounts, because it's the only account type that supports Push. Sync server deletions By default K-9 Mail removes downloaded messages from the device if the message has been deleted from the server. If you uncheck this setting K-9 Mail will keep the downloaded messages. When I delete a message You can control what happens when you delete a message using K-9 Mail. The following options are available: Do not delete on server (only from the device) Delete from server Mark as read on server (not available for POP3 accounts) Erase deleted messages on server Normally, messages on the server are simply marked for deletion. Here you can control when they are actually deleted (expunged). Available options: Immediately When polling Manually Note: Some clients can display messages that are marked for deletion and allow you to remove that flag, undeleting them. K-9 Mail currently doesn't support that functionality. Note: This setting is only available for IMAP accounts. Incoming server Please see Incoming Server Settings for the available settings. Advanced K-9 Mail supports some advanced settings for IMAP accounts. If you're not familiar with the details of the IMAP protocol you shouldn't change any of these settings. Poll when connecting for push When this is enabled K-9 Mail will do a full folder synchronization after establishing a Push connection. Otherwise it will only download new messages. Max folders to check with push K-9 Mail needs to establish one connection for each folder that is checked via Push. This can quickly add up and exceed the number of concurrent connections your mail server allows you to establish. This setting is intended as safety mechanism to limit the number of Push connections regardless of how many folders are configured to be checked via Push. Refresh IDLE connection Sending mail These settings control everything related to sending mail. Composition defaults Here you can configure your main identity. Your name This is the name that will be used in outgoing messages. Your email address This is the email address that will be used as the sending address for outgoing messages. Bcc all messages to Here you enter an email address that will receive a copy of all messages you send. Use signature Enable this to add a signature to all your messages. Signature Enter the signature text here. Note: You should start the signature with \"-- \" (dash, dash, space) on its own line. Most email clients will recognize this as start of the signature and e.g. allow stripping the signature when quoting messages in replies. Signature position Here you can specify where your signature should appear when replying to a message. Available options are: Before quoted text (your text, your signature, quoted text) After quoted text (your text, quoted text, your signature) Note: This setting will be ignored if you check the setting Reply after quoted text . Manage identities Here you can set up alternative identities consisting of name, email address, Reply-to address, and signature. Add an identity Select New identity from the menu to create a new identity. Delete an identity Long-press the name of an identity in the list of identities, then select Remove . Set default identity Long-press the name of an identity in the list of identities to open a menu that allows you to change the order of identities ( Move up , Move down , Move to top / make default ). The top-most identity is the default identity that will be used when composing a message from this account. Message Format Here you can configure the message format that is used for outgoing messages. The following options are available: Plain text (you will lose all formatting and inline images of the original message when forwarding/replying to a message; this will only send text/plain parts) HTML (keeps images and formatting; will additionally include a text/plain part) Automatic (same as Plain text when composing new messages; same as HTML when replying or forwarding messages) Always show Cc/Bcc Enabling this will always show the text fields to specify CC and BCC recipients in the message composition screen. Read receipt Checking this requests a read receipt for all outgoing messages. Note: This is adding a special header asking the recipient's email client to confirm that the message was received. Some clients (like K-9 Mail) do not support sending answers to this request. Others ask the user for confirmation before sending an answer. So not receiving a read receipt is not a reliable indicator that a message hasn't been read. Reply quoting style Defines your preference for the format in which the quoted text of the message you are replying to will appear from the following options: Prefix (like Gmail, Pine) - The quoted text appears below a one line header in the format Sender's Name <user@domain.TLD> wrote: . With the prefix option selected 2 additional options will be available: Reply after quoted text - When checked, the original message will appear above the reply you type into the message text box. Quoted text prefix - Defines the character(s) that will precede each line of quoted text. The default is '>'. Header (like Outlook, Yahoo!, and Hotmail) - The quoted text appears below a header that includes the Original Sender, Recipients, Time, and Subject from the original email's message header fields. Quote message when replying Uncheck this if by default you don't want to include the original message in your reply. You will still be able to include the original message by clicking the Quote message button in the message composition screen when replying to a message. Strip signatures on reply When this is checked K-9 Mail will try to detect the correspondents signature and remove it when quoting the original message. Outgoing server Please see Configuring the outgoing server for the available settings. Folders Auto-expand folder The folder you specify here will be opened when you click on an account in the account list. Set to -NONE- when clicking an account should open the folder list. Folders to display Here you can specify what folder classes should be displayed in the folder list. This can also be changed from the Show folders... sub-menu in the folder list. Available options are: All Only 1st Class folders 1st and 2nd Class folders All except 2nd Class folders To learn more about folder classes, read the page Folders . Move/copy destination folders This setting specifies which folders are displayed when you're asked to pick a destination folder for copy and move operations. Available options are: All Only 1st Class folders 1st and 2nd Class folders All except 2nd Class folders To learn more about folder classes, read the page Folders . Folders to search Here you specify what folders are searched when you start a search from the folder list or the account list. Searches from a message list only search messages in that list. Available options are: All Displayable (only folders matching Folders to display ) None Archive folder Here you can designate an archive folder. Messages will be moved there when the Archive action is used. Selecting -NONE- disables the archive functionality for this account. Note: This setting is not available for POP3 accounts. Drafts folder This specifies which folder is used to save message drafts. Select -NONE- to disable saving drafts. Note: This setting is not available for POP3 accounts. Sent folder A copy of sent messages is uploaded to this folder. Select -NONE- to disable this functionality. Please note that your mail server might save a copy of outgoing messages regardless. Note: This setting is not available for POP3 accounts. Spam folder Here you can designate a spam folder. Messages will be moved there when the Spam action is used. Selecting -NONE- disables this functionality. Please note that K-9 Mail does not have a spam filter included. Moving messages to a special spam folder will often train the spam filter on your mail server. If your server doesn't support this, you might as well disable this functionality and just delete messages. Note: This setting is not available for POP3 accounts. Trash folder Messages you delete in K-9 Mail are moved to the folder you specify here. If you select -NONE- K-9 Mail will delete messages instead of moving them to a trash folder. Note: This setting is not available for POP3 accounts. Storage Storage location This setting lets you choose whether to store email for the selected account using internal storage or external storage (SD card). Notifications Here you can specify whether and how you want to be notified of certain events. New mail notifications Enable this if you want K-9 Mail to create a notification each time a new (unread) message is downloaded. Include outgoing mail If this is unchecked K-9 Mail will not create notifications for downloaded messages that were sent by an address from one of your configured identities. New mail ringtone Specify the ringtone for the notification. Vibrate Check this to enable vibration when new mail arrives. Note: Even with this setting unchecked a notification can cause a vibration when you configured a ringtone and your device is switched to vibrate. This is controlled by Android, not K-9 Mail. Vibrate patterns Here you can select a vibration pattern for notifications. Available options: default (300ms off, 200ms on) pattern 1 (100ms off, 200ms on) pattern 2 (100ms off, 500ms on) pattern 3 (200ms off, 200ms on) pattern 4 (200ms off, 500ms on) pattern 5 (500ms off, 500ms on) Repeat vibration This setting specifies how often the vibration pattern is repeated. Available options are 1-10. Blink LED Check this to blink the LED when new mail arrives. Note: Not all devices have a notification LED. Unfortunately, there is no way for an app to find out if that's the case. So this setting is always visible, even when you can't use it. Notification LED color Here you can select the color the notification LED should blink in. Note: Not all devices allow you to specify arbitrary colors. Sync notifications If this is checked K-9 Mail will display a notification in the status bar as long as it is checking for new mail. Notification opens unread messages When this is enabled and there is more than one new message, K-9 Mail will display a message list containing all unread messages in this account (except those in the Trash , Drafts , Spam , Outbox , and Sent folders). Search In this section you can enable and configure the behavior of server-side search. Note: This is only available for IMAP accounts. Enable server search Enable this setting to be able to search messages on the server. Right now K-9 Mail only allows you to perform a remote search after doing a local search in a folder, i.e. starting a search from the folder list or the account list won't let you search the server. Note: Currently only the subject and sender of remote messages are searched. Server search limit Here you can specify how many search results are downloaded. K-9 Mail will only download the headers of found messages. The message contents are only downloaded after the message is opened for viewing. Available options are: 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, All. Cryptography This section allows you to select a crypto provider that allows you to encrypt/decrypt and sign/verify messages using the OpenPGP standard. Note: Currently only APG (Android Privacy Guard) and OpenKeychain are supported as a crypto provider. Check the PGP/MIME section for details on how to use it. OpenPGP Provider This allows you to select the crypto provider to use. Right now the only options are None , APG and OpenKeychain Auto-sign Enable this if you want to sign all messages sent with K-9 Mail. You will still be able to override this on a case-by-case basis in the screen to compose a message. Auto-encrypt Enable this if you want to encrypt all messages sent to a contact you have a public key for. You will still be able to override this on a case-by-case basis in the screen to compose a message.","title":"Account settings"},{"location":"settings/account.html#account-settings","text":"Many of the settings in K-9 Mail can be customized for each account, and are therefore located under Account Settings .

To this end, there are settings to be made on both Account and Folders. If you do not make any Class setting changes, K-9 will display all of your folders, but will not perform automatic synchronization on any of them, until you change the \"Email check frequency\" in the Account settings. Assigning classes Classes can be used to adjust both the display of your folders and the automatic synchronization. Only displayed folders will be synchronized, irrespective of the synchronization class settings. You can adjust the Account Class settings through the normal Account Settings Activity. To adjust the folder Class settings, use the new Folder Settings Activity. In the main folder list, long-press a folder. In Android Email, a long press on a folder does nothing. In K-9, it brings up a context menu, providing Refresh and Folder settings . Click Folder settings to adjust the Classes to which the folder is assigned. Folder display class First is the Folder display class A folder can be assigned to be in 1st Class , 2nd Class or None . The default is None . If you have a lot of folders, and only want to display a few, then assign those few to 1st Class . If you have a lot of folders, and only want to hide a few, assign those few to 2nd Class , and leave the multitude set to None . Folder sync class Second, it is also possible to separately set the \"Folder sync class\". By default, the folder's sync class is the same as the folder's display class. However, there are cases in which it is useful to have a different class for synchronization purposes. For instance, if there is a folder that you want to appear in your normal short list, but you do not want it to be automatically synced. Drafts is a good example of such a folder. In this case, assign the Drafts folder to be 1st Class for display but 2nd Class for sync. You will always have it in your folder list, but will not waste any battery power automatically keeping it in sync. Modes Now, in order to make use of the folder Class assignment, it is necessary to adjust two settings in the \"Account settings\": \"Folder display mode\" and \"Folder sync mode\". Display mode Folder display mode determines which folders are to be displayed. There are four choices: All : All folders are displayed. Only 1st Class folders : Only folders that were explicitly set to be 1st Class for their \"display class\" are shown. 1st and 2nd Class folders : Only folders that were explicitly set to be either 1st Class or 2nd Class for their \"display class\" are shown. All except 2nd Class folders : All folders are shown, except those that are selected to be in 2nd Class for their display class. Sync mode Folder sync mode determines which folders are to be automatically synchronized at the \"Email check frequency\". There are four choices: All : All displayed folders are automatically synchronized. Only 1st Class folders : Only displayed folders that were explicitly set to be 1st Class for their \"sync class\" are automatically synchronized 1st and 2nd Class folders : Only displayed folders that were explicitly set to be either 1st Class or 2nd Class for their \"sync class\" are automatically synchronized. All except 2nd Class folders : All displayed folders, except those that are selected to be in 2nd Class for their sync class, are automatically synchronized. Examples To show the utility of the various modes, it is probably best to show some use cases. In all cases, I have four folders available: Inbox, Janet, Carl and John. Use case 1: Just a few folders I want to see just my Inbox, Janet and Carl folders, and want all of those to be automatically synchronized.

Most of them define how the user interface should look like. Display The Display settings provide a lot of flexibility to control the global appearance of the app, as well as each of the main views, such as the account list, message lists and message display. Global Language By default K-9 Mail will display the user interface in the language you're using for your Android system. With this setting you can override the system language, e.g. if your Android version doesn't support your native language but K-9 Mail does. Theme Available themes: Light (default) Dark Fixed message theme When using the dark theme messages can look wrong. This is why K-9 Mail allows you to override the app theme. Enabling this setting will always use the theme configured in Message view theme below for the message view. Not using a fixed message theme means you can select a theme in the menu of the message view. Message view theme This setting specifies the theme that is used for the message view. Available settings: Light Dark Use app theme (default) Composer theme This setting specifies the theme that is used when composing a message. Available settings: Light Dark Use app theme (default) Font size K-9 allows you to configure the font-size for various sections of the app. Animation Here you can configure whether or not K-9 Mail will use animations. Currently this is only affects the animation when switching from the message list to the message view and back. Account List Show account size This setting controls whether or not the account size is displayed in the list of accounts. Disabling it can speed up the display a bit. Count search results Unchecking this will disable counting the number of unread and starred messages in the special accounts ( Unified Inbox and All messages ). Hide special accounts Here you can disable the special accounts Unified Inbox and All messages . Note: As of K-9 Mail v4.802, third-party applications can only access information about messages in the Unified Inbox . So disabling this can lead to those apps no longer working properly. Folder lists Wrap long folder names When this setting is enabled folder names that are longer than can be displayed in one line in the folder list will be wrapped and displayed using multiple lines rather than being shortened with \"...\" Message lists Preview lines Here you can specify how many lines of preview of a message you want to see in the message list. Note: If you set preview lines to 0 and disable contact pictures (see below) you get a special single line message list view. Show stars With this you can disable the star icon that is used to indicate flagged messages. Multi-select checkboxes Enable this to always show the checkboxes to select a message. Show correspondent names Disable this to display email addresses instead of correspondent names. Correspondent above subject Show correspondent names above the subject line, rather than below it. Show contact names Show correspondent names from Contacts when available. Colorize contacs Here you can select the color to use for correspondent names from your Contacts. All other correspondents will be displayed in the default color. Show contact pictures Disable this if you don't want to display contact pictures (or place holder images) in the message list. Colorize contact pictures If this is checked the place holder images for correspondents with missing contact pictures or ones not in your Contacts will be displayed in different colors. If this is disabled the images will be displayed with a grey background. Dim messages after reading Disabling this will display read and unread messages using the same background color in the message list. Then bold text in the first line is the only indicator that a message hasn't been read yet. Threaded view Threaded view is enabled by default and groups messages that belong to the same thread. Currently only messages in the same folder are grouped. Specifically, this will not include messages sent by you if those messages are not also stored in the current folder. Please note that this is not the same as the conversation view you might know from e.g. Gmail. To add own messages in threaded view: change Sent folder to INBOX in Folder settings under Account settings . Note: own messages are no longer stored (and synced) in Sent folder. Show split-screen This setting allows you to display the message list next to the message view. This is mainly useful for devices with a rather large screen, i.e. tablets. Available settings: Always Never When in Landscape orientation Fixed-width fonts When this is checked a fixed-width font will be used for plain text messages. The display of HTML messages is not influenced by this setting. Visible message actions Configure which message actions will be promoted to the first level of the menu in the message view. Note: Checking an item doesn't mean that this action will be displayed in the action bar. There is only a limited number of actions that will be displayed in the action bar, the rest will move to the so called overflow menu that is accessible using the icon with the three dots. Messages Auto-fit message Enable this to shrink messages to fit the screen width. Interaction Start in Unified Inbox When this setting is enabled K-9 Mail starts in the Unified Inbox . Note: You shouldn't use this setting. Pressing the launcher icon when K-9 Mail has been started before will restore the app to its old state rather than starting it again. Put a \"K-9 Accounts\" shortcut on your home screen to always open the Unified Inbox . Interaction/Gestures Note: This setting isn't currently used and will be removed soon. Interaction/Volume key navigation Here you can specify whether you want to use the hardware volume keys to move up and down in the message list, or move to the previous and next message in the message view. Interaction/Return to list after delete When this setting is enabled deleting a message in the message view will return to the message list rather than moving to the previous/next message. Interaction/Show next message after delete Enabling this setting always moves to the next message after deleting a message from the message view. When it is disabled you move to the next or previous message depending on your previous travel direction. Interaction/Confirm actions Here you can specify which actions should display a confirmation dialog. You can enable confirmations for the following actions: Delete (in message view) Delete Starred (in message view) Delete (from notification) Spam Notifications Only some options relating to notifications are shown here. Most of the settings for notifications are under Account Settings , which means you can choose different notification styles for each account. Quiet Time You can set a Quiet Time to prevent notification from disturbing your sleep. Quiet Time starts Here you can specify the time when notifications will be disabled. Quiet Time ends This time specifies the end of the Quiet Time , when notifications will be enabled again. Show 'Delete' button K-9 Mail supports deleting messages directly from a notification (on Android 4.1 and newer). The available settings are: Never (default) For single message notifications Always Network Background sync This setting specifies when K-9 Mail is allowed to synchronize messages in the background. Available settings are: When 'Auto-sync' is checked (see below) Always Never (This disables mail checking for all accounts regardless of the account settings) 'Auto-sync' is an Android-wide setting that controls accounts that link into the phone. Currently K-9 email accounts do not function in this way. However setting this will make the app reflect the global auto-sync setting. The configuration of Android's Auto-sync setting may vary depending on your phone's Android version and device manufacturer. On stock Android it's found under: \"Settings -> Users & accounts -> Automatically sync data\" Google provide information about auto-sync and Nexus phones Samsung provide instructions for their S6 phones. On a technical level this is the result from ContentResolver.getMasterSyncAutomatically() Miscellaneous Use Gallery bug work-around An old Android version shipped with a faulty Gallery app that didn't show any selectable items. To work around this bug K-9 Mail adds the options \"Add image\" and \"Add video\" to the menu of the message composition screen when this setting is enabled. Note: This setting should be automatically enabled when the faulty Gallery version is found on your device. Most users can ignore this setting and leave it unchecked. Save attachments to... Here you can specify a directory where your attachments are saved to when the \"Save\" button of an attachment is clicked. If a compatible file manager is installed (e.g. OI File Manager ) you can simply select a directory. Otherwise you'll have to type in its name. Privacy Hide subject in notifications This setting allows you to hide the subject of a message in notifications. Available options: Never (default) When device is locked Always Note: Currently, any value other than Never disables rich notifications (on Android versions that support them). This behavior will most likely change in the future to only disable the notification ticker that is visible from the lock screen. Debugging Enable debug logging Here you enable the logging of extra diagnostic information \u2013 e.g. if you're working with a developer to troubleshoot a problem. See the page on logging errors for more information. Remember to disable debug logging once it's no longer required. Log sensitive information By default, sensitive information like passwords are not saved in the logs, but this option enables logging of sensitive information.","title":"Global settings"},{"location":"settings/global.html#global-settings","text":"Global settings are account-independent settings.
