# Initial Set-Up / Welcome Screen

When you first launch K-9 you will be shown a welcome screen giving you a 
run down of the features. Clicking 'Next' allows you to [add an account](../accounts/add.md). Alternatively if you have 
previously exported your settings you can [import them](../settings/import.md).
